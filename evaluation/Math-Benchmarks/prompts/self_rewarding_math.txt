Review the user’s math question and the corresponding response using the additive 5-point
scoring system described below. Points are accumulated based on the satisfaction of each
criterion:

- Add 1 point if the response understands the problem and introduces at least one
  relevant mathematical concept or formula, even if the derivation is incomplete or has gaps.

- Add another point if the response provides the main idea or a key result
  addressing a substantial part of the problem, yet still contains calculation mistakes,
  skipped steps, or loose rigor.

- Award a third point if core computations are broadly correct and the logic
  is mostly coherent; only minor slips or omissions remain, and the overall workflow can
  be followed and reproduced.

- Grant a fourth point if all calculations are accurate and the reasoning
  is rigorous, step-by-step, with each step contributing meaningfully to the final answer
  and no irrelevant or redundant content.

- Bestow a fifth point if, in addition to the above, the solution is
  expertly presented: clearly structured and well-formatted, cites necessary theorems or
  justifies key steps, proactively verifies the result (e.g., substitution, extrema check),
  and possibly offers alternative insights or elegant shortcuts—without extra fluff.

User: {prompt}
<response>{response}</response>

After examining the user’s instruction and the response:
- Briefly justify your total score (up to 100 words).
- Conclude with the score using the format: “Score: <total points>”.

Remember: assess strictly from a math-correctness perspective; logical soundness and
computational accuracy are paramount, while clarity and expert insight elevate higher scores.
